8291recovery by the procurement organization to proceed, or, if the medical examiner or designee8292reasonably believes that the part may be involved in determining the decedent's cause or8293manner of death, deny recovery by the procurement organization.8294(7) If the medical examiner or designee denies recovery under Subsection (6), the8295medical examiner or designee shall:8296(a) explain in a record the specific reasons for not allowing recovery of the part;8297(b) include the specific reasons in the records of the medical examiner; and8298(c) provide a record with the specific reasons to the procurement organization.8299(8) If the medical examiner or designee allows recovery of a part under Subsection (4),8300(5), or (6), the procurement organization, upon request, shall cause the physician or technician8301who removes the part to provide the medical examiner with a record describing the condition8302of the part, a biopsy, a photograph, and any other information and observations that would8303assist in the postmortem examination.8304(9) If a medical examiner or designee is required to be present at a removal procedure8305under Subsection (6), upon request the procurement organization requesting the recovery of the8306part shall reimburse the medical examiner or designee for the additional costs incurred in8307complying with Subsection (6).8308Section 264.
