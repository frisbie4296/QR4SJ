			There has been a dramatic rise in anti transgender legislation being proposed and being passed across the US. These bills have very real and horrible effects on people’s lives. How do we conceptualize how overwhelming these numbers are? How do we make sure that we are still humanizing the data as we work with it? Youtuber Lindsay Ellis refers to this as the vulgarity of numbers in her video essay <url href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QwpanShgOp4ampt=1s">"The unforgivable sin of Ms. Rachel"</url>. One tool we can learn in this chapter is to explore the numbers from different numerical lenses. We can also explore how people gather and talk about data on transgender individuals.</p>

        <title>Looking at Data about Anti-transgender legislation (making sense of the numbers we see)</title>
        <p>
            There are many ways people choose to represent data. We use visuals to quickly communicate ideas to others. From bargraphs and tables, scatterplots, maps, to infographics and more we can tell a story about a population or problem. 
        </p>
        <activity>
            <p> In this activity, we will consider data on bills that impact transgender and gender-diverse people across the United States from <url href= "https://translegislation.com/">Trans Legislation Tracker</url>. Trans Legislation Tracker is an independent research organization tracking bills that impact trans and gender-diverse people across the United States. The link we are using goes to 2025 data. </p>
            <p> Begin by going to the Trans Legislation Tracker above. </p>
            <ol>    
                <li> What is the first thing you notice? </li>
                <li> Scroll down to the graph displaying the number of anti-transgender bills that were considered versus the number that were passed. What are your initial thoughts on the way this data is presented? </li>
				<li> Now, scroll down to the section that displays the types of bills that are being proposed. What different pieces of information are you able to gather from this section? Try to name at least two. </li>
				<li> For the map-based visualization of anti-transgender bills, select one or more states. What do you notice across the different states you selected? Feel free to comment on the data and information itself or also on the way it is displayed. </li>
				<li> Navigate to the “Previous Years” tab on the navigation bar. Select a past year and compare your findings. </li>

		<title> Reading the Story from Data </title>
		<p>Many places document data about anti-transgender legislation that are introduced, however the questions they ask differ. In this section, we will explore what stories are highlighted through different datasets. </p>
		<activity>
			<p> In this activity we'll use data sets created by the ACLU to help us see what questions we wondered in the preactivity we can answer as well as become comfortable with exploring data sets using spreadsheets. The ACLU (American Civil Liberties Union) has tracked anti-LGBTQ bills in the U.S. State Legislature in years <url href="https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights-2023">2023</url>, <url href="https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights-2024">2024</url>, and <url href="https://www.aclu.org/legislative-attacks-on-lgbtq-rights-2025">2025</url>. </p>
			<ol> 
				<li> <p> What does this data tell us? </p>
					<ol>
						<li>Download the CSVs of this data (there is a link to do so at the bottom of the table).</li>
						<li>Review the dataset. What do you notice? What is interesting about this data?</li>
						<li>Choose a state. How many bills were defeated in that state? How many bills were passed into law? Are there issues that are more likely to be defeated? Are there issues that are more likely to be passed into law? </li>
						<li>Compare what your group discovered to what other groups discovered about their states. What do you wonder? </li>
						<li>Use the data to try to explore your questions that you wondered in the preactivity or what you are wondering now. </li>
					</ol> 
				</li>
				<li> Graphs and charts are a powerful way to explore data. Using data from your state, create a graph to revisualize the data. For example, you can explore the status of the bills or the issues of the bills. </li> 
				<li> What is missing from this data? </li>
				<li> What stories are told by the sites, vs what stories are your visuals telling us. </li>
				<li> What are the other ways this story could be told? </li>
			</ol>
			<p> The numbers on the <url href="https://translegislation.com/">translegislation</url> tracker are really large and it can be difficult to fathom or be hard to grapple with. Number sense and exploration allow us to get a better understanding of the information. For example, we can answer what proportion of anti transgender legislation is passing. But without other numbers to compare this to, it can still be difficult to understand the scale at which these bills are being created. </p>
